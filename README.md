# Decision Tree Classifier

## Introdution
This is a repository for a university project. 

The subject is "Metodi statistici per l'apprendimento" and we want to do a tree classifier.

Thanks to @random-forests for the tutorial on developing a decision tree classifier from scratch. Part of scripts are made by him in a youtube tutorial.

You can see in the history what has be done by me.


## Dependencies
Most of the modules are built in, but you can install the remaining ones with: ```pip install x```

These are the modules used in this project:
- csv
- math
- numpy
- pathlib
- time
- os.path
- matplotlib

## Dataset setup

1. put the dataset data (.csv) in  "Datasets"
2. put the dataset header (.csv) in  "Datasets". Just the titles of the columns


## Input Example

[This will be done later]
